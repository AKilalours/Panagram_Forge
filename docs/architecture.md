The loop is the project. Everything else is plumbing that makes the loop measurable.

## Why the loop, specifically

A conventional detector is trained once on whatever synthetic data was convenient and
then degrades as new models appear. The claim under test here is that choosing *which*
synthetic data to generate, based on where the current model actually fails, buys more
robustness per example than generating more data at random. That is why the Failure
Atlas sits between evaluation and generation instead of being a debugging convenience.

See `docs/data_spec_v1.md` for the frozen data contract and `docs/jd_coverage.md` for
the infrastructure map.
