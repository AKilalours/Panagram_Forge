"""Label polarity, and the refusals that keep a wrong verdict off the page.

The bug this file mostly exists for: assuming output index 1 is the AI class. A published
classifier may order its classes either way. Guessing wrong inverts every verdict on the
page while everything looks normal, which is exactly what happened to the MAGE benchmark in
the text track, where a wrong polarity would have turned an AUROC of 0.05 into a reported
0.95.
