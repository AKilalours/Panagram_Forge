WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. There are now two pages over the same detectors: the FastAPI page in
api/forge_app.py and the Streamlit page in streamlit_app.py, which is what actually deploys
because free Docker hosting went away. Two pages rendering one payload is precisely the
shape of every wrong answer this project has shipped: a second copy that nobody updates
when the first is corrected. These tests hold the two together at the seams that matter.
