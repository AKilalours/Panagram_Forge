"""Generation must hold one engine at a time and must batch.

THE TWO BUGS THIS CAME FROM, both invisible without a GPU.

1. ENGINES HELD CONCURRENTLY. Documents are assigned to generator families round-robin,
   and the runner cached a generator per family, so every family's engine was alive at
   once. A vLLM engine reserves ~90% of the card at startup, so the second one found
   1.03 GiB free of 23.53 and the run died with

       ValueError: Free memory on device (1.03/23.53 GiB) on startup is less than
       desired GPU memory utilization (0.9, 21.17 GiB)

2. ONE PROMPT PER CALL. The runner called generate([single_prompt]) once per document.
   That is correct and unusable: a 640-token completion from a 3B model decodes at
   roughly 60-100 tok/s, about 8 seconds a document, so 60k documents is over 130 hours.
   Continuous batching is the only reason vLLM is on the generation side at all, and
   one-at-a-time never engages it.

Neither shows up with the fake backend, where generators are free and instant, which is
why a green suite said nothing about either. These tests assert the SHAPE of the calls
rather than their speed, so they run without a GPU.
