"""`forge mine` must actually mine.

The bug this file exists for: the command loaded the config, raised PhaseNotImplemented if
`--model` was absent, and RETURNED if it was present. Satisfying the documented precondition
produced exit code 0, no output and no work. `run_round` was never called from anywhere but
the tests.

The first test fails against that version: it asserts the round ran and wrote a file.
