"""What the interface is allowed to say.

Two rules, both about claims the product cannot support:

  A detector cannot establish that a person made something. It reports whether the input
  resembles the AI distribution it was trained on. "HUMAN" is a claim about the world;
  "NO AI DETECTED" is a claim about the model, and only the second one is true.

  Version identifiers belong in the payload, not on the face of the product. "FORGE-Image
  v0.4" beside a verdict reads as a released product to anyone who does not know the
  project, and the string changes every run.
