"""Dedup tests.

Note on the fixtures: BASE is deliberately varied prose rather than one sentence
repeated. Shingles are stored as a set, so a document built by repeating one sentence
has a tiny distinct-shingle set (39 for a 4x repeat), and appending a single sentence
adds 11 new shingles, dropping true Jaccard to 0.78. That is genuinely below the 0.8
threshold, so a repetitive fixture makes this test assert something false about
near-duplicate detection rather than testing it.

    "lower fields had finished the harvest weeks earlier, and the barns along the road "
    "stood full and shuttered against the coming cold. A narrow track climbed from the "
    "village toward the ridge, where a line of oaks marked the boundary of the common "
    "land. In the evenings the wind turned and brought the smell of woodsmoke down into "
