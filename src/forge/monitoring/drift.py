"""Drift detection on the production score distribution.

A rising AI-probability distribution in production usually means one of two things: the
world changed (a new model everyone started using), or the detector did (a bad deploy).
Both go to the Failure Atlas. Neither goes straight to training.

The distinction that matters for interpreting an alert:

  score drift  the distribution of what the model OUTPUTS moved. Could be the model,
               could be the traffic.
  input drift  the distribution of what the model RECEIVES moved. If inputs are stable
               and scores moved, the model changed, and that is a deploy problem.

Reporting only score drift makes every incident ambiguous. Both are computed here.

PSI thresholds follow the usual convention (0.1 minor, 0.25 significant), which is a rule
of thumb from credit scoring, not a law. It is stated as a convention in the output so
nobody mistakes it for a derived number.
