"""User feedback intake.

Raw thumbs-down NEVER becomes a training label. Users disagree with correct predictions
constantly, and a document's author is exactly the person most motivated to dispute a
correct "AI" verdict. A detector that learns from unverified disagreement learns to agree
with whoever complains loudest, and its false-negative rate climbs where it matters most.

So feedback is a state machine with a human in it:

    submitted -> under_review -> verified   -> Failure Atlas
                              -> rejected   -> discarded, counted
                              -> unverifiable -> discarded, counted

Only `verified` items reach the atlas, and only with a label a verifier supplied. The
counts of rejected and unverifiable items are kept, because a rising rejection rate is
itself a signal that something upstream is wrong.
