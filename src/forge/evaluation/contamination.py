"""Contamination checking between training data and external benchmarks.

A single training document that also appears in RAID or MAGE invalidates the external
claim, and overlap raises no error on its own: the model simply scores better and the
number looks like a win.

Two checks, because exact-hash alone is not enough.

**Exact.** Content hash of the normalised text. The normalisation MUST be the identical
function ingestion used, or two byte-different-but-identical documents hash differently
and the overlap is missed. That is why this module imports `normalize` from the cleaning
pipeline rather than reimplementing it. Anyone tempted to write a quick local
`text.lower().strip()` here would produce a check that passes while contamination is
present, which is worse than no check at all.

**Near-duplicate.** MinHash over word shingles. FineWeb and RAID both draw on public web
text, so a training document and a benchmark document can be the same article with
different boilerplate, a different crawl date, or a light rewrite. Those contaminate just
as badly as an exact match and exact hashing misses every one of them.

**The near-duplicate threshold here is deliberately looser than deduplication's.**
Deduplication uses 0.8; contamination defaults to 0.5. The error costs run in opposite
directions:

    dedup false positive        -> two distinct documents merged, training data lost
    dedup false negative        -> a near-duplicate pair straddles a split

    contamination false positive -> a pair gets flagged for manual review, cheap
    contamination false negative -> the external result is invalid and nobody knows

Reusing 0.8 here would be inheriting a threshold tuned for the opposite trade. A short
benchmark document with a sentence of site boilerplate appended sits at a true Jaccard of
about 0.75, which 0.8 misses and 0.5 catches. Over-flagging costs a look; under-flagging
costs the headline claim.
