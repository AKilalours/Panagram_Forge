"""External benchmark loaders. EVAL-ONLY, always.

Schemas below were read from the live dataset cards on 2026-08-31 and are recorded in
data_spec_v1 section 1.1. They are pinned here as constants so a silent upstream schema
change fails loudly at load time instead of producing a plausible wrong number.

Nothing in this file has been run against the real datasets. Neither the development
sandbox nor the cloud container can reach huggingface.co, so every loader is verified
against synthetic fixtures matching the recorded schema exactly. The parsing logic is
tested; the download is not.

Three per-dataset traps, each of which produces a believable but wrong result:

  MAGE polarity. The card says label 1 means machine-generated; the original
  DeepfakeTextDetect release used the opposite convention in places. An inverted label
  turns an AUROC of 0.05 into a reported 0.95 and nothing crashes. Asserted at load.

  HC3 shape. `human_answers` and `chatgpt_answers` are LISTS. One row expands to several
  documents, so row counts are not document counts, and every document from one question
  must share a group id or the same question appears on both sides of any split.

  RAID adversarial grouping. Twelve attacks are applied to the same base generations, and
  they share `source_id`. Scoring them as independent documents counts one base text up
  to thirteen times and lets a single easy or hard base text dominate the number.
