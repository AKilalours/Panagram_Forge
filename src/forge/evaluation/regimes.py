"""Constructors for the five evaluation regimes. Plan section 13, gap G3.

The regimes were configured and the lab could score them, but nothing built them from
data. These functions do that.

The rule every constructor obeys: **partition by group, never by row.** A held-out domain
or a held-out generation era still has to respect `source_group_id`, or a human document
lands in train while its mirror lands in the OOD test set and the "unseen domain" result
is measuring memorisation instead.
