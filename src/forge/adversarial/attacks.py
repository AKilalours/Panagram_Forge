"""The adversarial laboratory.

Ours are controlled so a degradation can be attributed to one specific transformation.
RAID's twelve attacks are the independent external check, because attacks we wrote
ourselves are attacks we implicitly designed around.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The thing that makes this measurement subtle
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORGE's own ingestion pipeline NEUTRALISES several of these attacks before the model ever
sees the text. `normalize()` applies NFKC, strips zero-width characters and collapses
whitespace runs. So homoglyph, zero-width and whitespace attacks are largely defused by
preprocessing, not by the model.

That means a single robustness number is meaningless, and it can be wrong in either
direction:

  measure WITH preprocessing only  -> overstates the model's robustness. The credit
                                      belongs to two lines of `normalize()`, and any
                                      deployment that skips them is unprotected.
  measure WITHOUT preprocessing    -> overstates vulnerability, and reports a threat the
                                      production path already handles.

So every attack is evaluated in both conditions and the report shows both columns. The
gap between them is the value of the preprocessing defence, stated as a number instead of
assumed. See `Attack.defused_by_preprocessing`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Validity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An attack that mangles text until a human cannot read it is not an evasion, it is
vandalism, and counting it inflates the reported vulnerability. Every attack carries a
`preserves_meaning` check and the runner records attacks that failed it rather than
scoring them.

All attacks are deterministic, seeded per document, so a robustness table can be
regenerated exactly.
