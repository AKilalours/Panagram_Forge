"""Classical image forensics: everything about a file that needs no trained model.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. A detector's verdict is one signal among several. A JPEG carries its own
history in its quantisation tables, its EXIF, its compression residual and its container
structure, and none of that requires a GPU, a model, or an internet connection. Those
signals are also the ones a reader can verify themselves, which makes them the right thing
to show first.

THE RULE THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND, and it is not decoration.

    EVERY VALUE IS READ FROM THE FILE OR REPORTED AS ABSENT.

There is no placeholder camera, no invented capture date, no default "looks fine". A tool
whose job is establishing whether an image is authentic cannot itself display a fabricated
provenance record. Where a signal is unavailable, the field says `None` and the UI says
"not available", which is information; a plausible-looking default is a lie.

WHAT THESE SIGNALS CAN AND CANNOT DO. Each finding carries a `caveat` naming its own limit,
because forensic signals are suggestive, not conclusive:

  - A stripped EXIF block is normal for anything that has been through a social platform,
    a screenshot, or a chat app. It is not evidence of generation.
  - Standard quantisation tables mean the file was written by a library using defaults,
    which describes most AI pipelines AND most re-saved photographs.
  - Error level analysis responds to any re-encode, including an innocent one.
  - Resampling periodicity is destroyed by a subsequent JPEG pass.

Reporting these as "evidence of AI" would be exactly the false-positive behaviour the whole
project exists to avoid. They are reported as what they are: facts about the file.
