"""Arm A for images: AI images generated WITHOUT reference to any photograph.

This is the control the whole image experiment is measured against, and it is easy to get
subtly wrong in a way that makes the comparison meaningless.

WHAT MUST BE IDENTICAL TO THE MIRROR ARM
    the generator families and their pinned revisions
    the generation spec: scheduler, steps, guidance, resolution
    the normalisation applied to the output
    the number of accepted images

WHAT MUST DIFFER, AND IS THE ONLY THING THAT MAY
    where the prompt came from. A mirror's prompt describes a specific photograph. A
    control's prompt is drawn from a fixed inventory of scenes that no photograph informed.

If anything in the first list differs, a win for the mirror arm is attributable to that
difference instead of to matching. The text track came within one config field of exactly
this failure: both arms pointed at the same directory and would have produced identical
numbers supporting the conclusion "matching makes no difference".

WHY AN INVENTORY RATHER THAN RANDOM WORDS. The control has to be a plausible attempt at
generating AI images, not a strawman. Someone building a detector without FORGE's mirror
idea would prompt a diffusion model with ordinary scene descriptions, so that is what the
control does. A control made deliberately weak proves nothing.

WHY THE LENGTH ANALOGUE IS RESOLUTION AND ASPECT. The text control samples its target
lengths from the human corpus so the two arms match in length distribution without matching
in content. The image equivalent is that the control renders at the same resolution and
aspect as the mirror arm, and both are normalised to the same square, so neither arm can be
identified by its geometry.
