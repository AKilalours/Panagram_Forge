"""Transformations an AI image picks up on its way to being posted, and to being judged.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A detector that works on pristine generator output and fails on a
screenshot of it is not a detector, because nobody uploads pristine generator output. The
adversarial suite measures the gap.

THE ORDERING TRAP, which is the whole reason this module has a long docstring.

FORGE normalises every image before the model sees it: resize, centre crop, re-encode as
JPEG at a fixed quality, strip metadata. That normalisation is what stops the detector
learning that photographs are JPEG and generations are PNG.

But normalisation ALSO destroys most of what an attack does. Run an attack after it and
"JPEG quality 40" becomes "JPEG quality 40 then re-encoded at 90", which measures almost
nothing; "metadata strip" becomes a no-op, because normalisation already stripped it.

So the order is fixed and non-negotiable:

    generator output -> ATTACK -> normalisation -> model

which is the order a real upload experiences: someone screenshots an image, then a website
resizes and re-encodes it, then a detector reads it. Every function here returns raw bytes
intended to be passed through forge.image.normalize afterwards, never instead.

A test in this module's suite asserts that at least one attack still changes the normalised
result. If normalisation flattened every attack, the robustness table would be a column of
zeros that looked like excellent robustness.

WHAT COUNTS AS AN ATTACK. Only transformations that leave the image recognisably the same
picture. Destroying an image until a detector fails is not an attack, it is vandalism, and
it tells you nothing about robustness. Each function documents what it preserves.
