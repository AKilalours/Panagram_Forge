"""One analysis of one image, assembled into the panels a person actually reads.

WHY REPORTS ARE SEPARATE FROM FORENSICS. The forensic functions produce facts about a file.
A report is a document shown to a human, and the dangerous step is the one where facts
become a verdict. That step gets its own file, with its own rules, rather than being
scattered through a template.

THE TWO RULES.

1. THE VERDICT COMES FROM THE DETECTOR OR IT DOES NOT EXIST. FORGE-Image's heads are not
   trained, so `assessment.available` is False and no confidence is shown. The reference
   design this page follows puts a large "Human, 98.2%" at the top; that number comes from
   a calibrated model, and manufacturing it from metadata would be worst on exactly the
   images a detector must never accuse. Screenshots, chat-app downloads and re-saved
   photographs all have no EXIF and library quantisation tables, so any naive combination
   scores ordinary human images as suspicious.

2. EVIDENCE STREAMS ARE REPORTED, NOT SUMMED. See forge.image.evidence for why. The short
   version: the signals describe how a file was written, not what is in it, and averaging
   them destroys the one genuinely informative case, which is disagreement between them.

WHAT IS REAL TODAY, with no model and no GPU: container format, EXIF, camera consistency,
C2PA presence, self-declared generation markers, quantisation tables, error level analysis,
resampling periodicity, noise consistency, colour statistics, perceptual hash, and a
transform-stability check that shows which signals survive resizing, recompression and
metadata removal. That last one is a real robustness result about the FILE; detector
robustness needs the detector and says so.
