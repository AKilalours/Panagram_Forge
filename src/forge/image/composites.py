"""Images that are part real and part generated, with a known mask.

WHY. The localisation head answers "where is the evidence", and that question cannot be
trained or scored without ground truth. Hand-labelling is not an option at this scale, and
eyeballing a heatmap is not a metric. Constructing the composite ourselves gives a mask
that is exact by definition.

THE TRAP, and it is the image analogue of the JPEG confound.

Paste a generated patch into a photograph and you have introduced something far more
learnable than any generation artifact: a seam. A hard rectangular boundary between two
image statistics is trivially detectable, and a model trained on such composites will find
the seam, score beautifully on IoU, and locate nothing at all in a real AI-edited image
whose edit was blended.

Three defences, all applied here:

1. SHAPE AND FEATHER VARY. Rectangles, ellipses, and soft-edged blends, so no single edge
   profile is the signal.

2. HUMAN-HUMAN COMPOSITES ARE BUILT TOO. A region taken from ANOTHER photograph is pasted
   with exactly the same machinery. Those carry the same seam and are labelled as having no
   AI region at all. A model that keys on the seam cannot separate them from the real
   composites, so seam-learning stops paying.

3. THE WHOLE COMPOSITE IS RENORMALISED. One JPEG pass over the finished image, so the
   pasted region does not carry its own compression history.

Defence 2 is the important one. It is the same instrument as the negative control: build the
shortcut into BOTH classes and it stops being a shortcut.
