"""What FORGE publishes about an image corpus: everything except the pixels.

THE RULE, inherited unchanged from the text track. Open Images lists its images as CC BY
2.0 while the maintainers explicitly disclaim any warranty about the license status of any
individual image, and say the user must verify each one. FORGE therefore treats the license
string as a CLAIM CARRIED FROM THE SOURCE, not as a fact it has established, and never
redistributes the pixels.

What is published is a manifest: ids, source URLs, the recorded license and attribution,
a perceptual hash, the normalisation policy version, and the split assignment. A reader can
reconstruct the corpus from it, and the reconstruction is verifiable because the hashes
must match. Nothing in the manifest is anyone's copyrighted content.

This is not legal caution for its own sake. A project shown to a company is partly a claim
about how its author handles data they do not own.
