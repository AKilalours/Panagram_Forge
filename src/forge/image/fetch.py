"""Turn a list of upstream image ids into a normalised corpus and a manifest.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a scraper. It reads a list of ids and license metadata that
the upstream dataset publishes, fetches exactly those, and records what it was told about
each one. Nothing is discovered, followed or crawled.

THREE THINGS THAT SOUND LIKE PLUMBING AND ARE NOT.

1. Normalisation happens HERE, at fetch time, before anything is stored. If images were
   stored as downloaded and normalised later, some stage would eventually read the raw
   ones, and the difference between raw and normalised is precisely the source signature
   the whole track is built to remove. Normalising once, at the boundary, means a raw
   photograph never exists inside FORGE.

2. The perceptual hash is computed on the NORMALISED bytes. Hashing the original would let
   two copies of one photograph, stored at different sizes, pass as distinct.

3. Failures are recorded rather than skipped. A corpus that quietly shrinks when a URL rots
   is a corpus whose size depends on the day it was built. The reasons are counted and
   returned so the manifest's summary can state how many images were requested against how
   many were obtained.
