"""The test that decides whether any image result is real.

THE PROBLEM. A human/AI image classifier can reach near-perfect accuracy by learning the
difference between two ENCODING PIPELINES rather than between a photograph and a
generation. Every headline metric looks excellent while this happens, so no amount of
staring at AUROC will reveal it.

THE TEST. Take human images only. Split them into two arbitrary halves and label one half
0 and the other 1. There is no real signal: the labels are a coin flip by construction. If
a model trained on that reaches meaningfully better than chance, it is reading something
about the images that correlates with how they were selected or encoded, and every number
produced by the real experiment is void.

This is cheap, it runs before the expensive work, and it is the only thing that separates
"my detector works" from "my pipeline leaks".

The harness takes the trainer as a callable so it can be exercised without a GPU. What is
tested here is the LOGIC of the control: that labels are arbitrary but reproducible, that
the pass/fail threshold accounts for sampling noise, and that a leaking pipeline is
actually caught.
