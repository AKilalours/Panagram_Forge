"""Generate an AI image matched to a photograph, and refuse the ones that are not matched.

THE SHAPE, identical to the text mirror engine:

    photograph -> caption -> prompt -> generator -> candidate -> validate -> mirror

and the photograph is discarded after captioning. Only the caption crosses.

WHAT "VALID" MEANS HERE, and why it needs two checks rather than one.

A generated image can fail to be a mirror in two opposite ways, and a single similarity
threshold catches only one of them.

  TOO DISSIMILAR. The generator ignored the prompt, or the caption was too vague to steer
  it. The pair is then a random photograph next to a random generation, which is the
  control arm, not the mirror arm. Training on it while calling it a mirror would silently
  turn arm B into a second copy of arm A.

  TOO SIMILAR. The generator reproduced something close to a memorised training image, or
  the caption was specific enough to name a particular real photograph. Now the AI example
  contains the human example's content, the two classes overlap, and the detector is being
  asked to separate an image from itself.

So similarity to the source must land inside a BAND. That is the image analogue of the
text validator's length-ratio window, and it exists for the same reason: a mirror that is
too close is contamination and one that is too far is not a mirror.

NORMALISATION IS APPLIED TO THE OUTPUT HERE. Generated images leave the pipeline as
lossless PNG at the generator's native resolution; photographs arrived as JPEG. If the two
populations were stored differently the detector would learn the encoder. See
forge/image/normalize.py, which is the same function ingestion used.
