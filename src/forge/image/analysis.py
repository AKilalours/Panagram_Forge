"""One image analysis, two shells.

The FastAPI route and the Streamlit page must produce the same payload, because they render
the same cards from it. This is the body of `POST /v1/image/analyze` with the HTTP parts
lifted out: the route keeps the upload limits and the status codes, this keeps the work.

`UnsupportedImage` carries the same distinction the route made: a format this build cannot
decode is NAMED, because "unreadable" sends a reader nowhere while "HEIC needs a decoder"
tells them what to do.
