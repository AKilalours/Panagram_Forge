"""Where the detector's decision comes from, measured by occlusion. CPU, one forward pass.

WHY NOT THE FORENSIC MAPS. Compression residual, noise floor and local contrast are pixel
statistics. They describe the file and they know nothing about the model, so putting them
where an attribution map belongs invites the reader to treat "bright here" as "the detector
thinks this region is generated". It never meant that.

WHY OCCLUSION RATHER THAN GRAD-CAM. Grad-CAM and attention rollout need to know where a
particular architecture keeps its spatial tokens, so they break silently when the detector
is swapped, and this project swaps detectors. Occlusion asks the model a question it cannot
misunderstand: hide this region, does the AI probability fall? A region whose removal drops
the score is a region the decision rested on. It works on any classifier, it is exact rather
than an approximation of a gradient, and it is trivially explainable to a reader.

WHY IT IS FAST ENOUGH ON A CPU. The occluded variants are built in the model's own
preprocessed tensor space, after the single expensive resize, and scored in ONE batched
forward pass rather than one call per tile. A 5x5 grid is 26 images through a ViT at 224
pixels, which is a couple of seconds, against roughly half a minute for the naive loop.

WHAT THE VALUES MEAN. Each cell is `P(AI) with the region visible` minus `P(AI) with it
hidden`, so a positive cell is evidence the model used FOR its AI call and a negative cell
is evidence against. Occlusion replaces a region with the dataset mean colour, which is
itself an unusual thing to show a model, so a cell says "this region mattered", not "this
region is generated".
