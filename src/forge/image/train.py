"""The image training loop, and the sample index it trains on.

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. Everything upstream of here produces PIECES: a manifest of
photographs, mirrors, unmatched generations, composites with masks. Assembling those into a
training set is where the experiment is actually decided, and it is where the mistakes are
silent. This module does the assembly explicitly and asserts the properties the comparison
depends on, rather than leaving them to be true by accident.

THE FOUR DECISIONS THAT CHANGE RESULTS

1. THE ARMS DIFFER IN ONE PLACE ONLY. Arm A trains on unmatched generations, Arm B on
   mirrors. Both draw the SAME human photographs and the SAME composites. If the human pool
   differed between arms, any gap would be a data gap rather than a treatment effect, and
   the writeup's central claim would be unsupported. `assert_arms_comparable` checks the
   shared parts are identical by id, not merely equal in count. Equal counts are the check
   that looks right and proves nothing.

2. THE AI BUDGET IS EQUALISED BY TRUNCATION, DETERMINISTICALLY. The mirror arm rejects more
   than the control arm does, so it finishes smaller. Training the control on more data and
   then reporting that it did better would be measuring dataset size. Both arms are cut to
   the smaller AI count, and which samples survive the cut is chosen by hash so the cut is
   reproducible and independent of the order files were written in.

3. COMPOSITES BELONG TO NEITHER ARM. They are the only localisation supervision that exists,
   so withholding them from one arm would cripple its local head for reasons unrelated to
   the treatment. They enter both arms unchanged and are excluded from the AI budget count,
   because they are not the treatment.

4. THE THRESHOLD IS FIT ON VAL AND APPLIED TO TEST, ONCE. Choosing the operating point on
   the split you report is how an FPR-at-budget number becomes fiction.

THE LEAKAGE RULE, restated because this is where it would break. A photograph, every mirror
generated from it, every composite built on it, share `group_id` and therefore a split. That
is enforced upstream by `assign_split(image_id)`; it is RE-CHECKED here, on the assembled
index, because an assembly bug is exactly the kind that upstream tests cannot see.

torch is imported lazily so this module imports, and the index logic tests, on a machine
with no GPU and no torch.
