"""Perceptual hashing for near-duplicate image detection.

WHY NOT A CONTENT HASH. The text track deduplicates with exact hashes plus MinHash over
shingles. Neither transfers: two JPEG encodings of the same photograph share no bytes, and
an image has no tokens to shingle. Re-encoding, resizing and requantising all change every
byte while changing nothing a person would notice.

Near-duplicates matter here for the same reason they do in text. If a photograph appears
twice and one copy is mirrored into the AI class, the detector sees near-identical content
on both sides of the label and learns whichever incidental difference distinguishes them.
Worse, duplicates that straddle a split inflate every metric.

DHASH, not average hash. Average hash compares each pixel to the image mean, which makes it
sensitive to global brightness and blind to structure. Dhash compares each pixel to its
right-hand neighbour, so it encodes gradients: it survives brightness and contrast changes,
JPEG requantisation and moderate resizing, which are exactly the transformations an image
picks up on its way through a hosting pipeline.

Implemented here rather than imported so the bit layout is fixed and reproducible. A
library upgrade must never silently change what "duplicate" means in a frozen dataset.
