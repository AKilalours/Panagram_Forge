"""Character-level ground truth for the token head. data_spec_v1 v1.2.

The problem this solves: mirrors give clean document-level labels, but the token head
has to say WHERE a document turns from human to AI, and nothing in the mirror corpus
carries that information.

Three constructions, and the third is the one that keeps the other two honest.

  splice          human paragraphs interleaved with paragraphs from that same document's
                  own mirror. Boundaries are exact and free. Weakness: the seam is an
                  abrupt discontinuity, and a token head can learn "something changed
                  here" instead of "the author changed here".

  edit_diff       a human document partially rewritten by a model; the character diff
                  gives the ai_assisted spans. This is what real AI-assisted writing
                  looks like, and there is no artificial seam. Costs model time.

  splice_control  paragraphs from two DIFFERENT human documents, every span labelled
                  human. Not optional. Without it a token head can score well on the
                  splice set purely by detecting discontinuity, and no metric in the
                  evaluation lab would reveal that. The control is the experiment that
                  distinguishes "detects authorship" from "detects seams".

All three inherit source_group_id and split from their human source, exactly like
mirrors. A control built from two human documents is only ever built from two documents
already in the same split, and inherits the first one's group.
