"""Generator backends behind one interface.

Note the asymmetry with serving. vLLM belongs HERE, on the generation side, where the
workload is autoregressive decoding of hundreds of thousands of documents and
continuous batching genuinely helps. It does not belong on the detector's serving path,
which runs a bidirectional encoder with a fixed window and no KV cache. See
src/forge/inference/server.py.

Every backend must report a concrete `revision`. `require_pinned_revision` refuses to
run against an unpinned model, because "generated with Qwen 7B" is not a reproducible
statement: the upstream repo can move and the same config would then produce different
data under the same dataset version.
