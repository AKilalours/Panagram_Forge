"""Phase 1 orchestration: config in, FORGE-HUMAN out.

One design point worth stating. Deduplication is shared across all sources in a run,
not per source. FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu are both derived from Common Crawl, so the same
page can appear in both. Deduping per source would let that pair through, and the pair
would land in different splits, which is the leak this whole pipeline is built to
prevent.

    This function exists because of a real bug. The runner previously contained the line

        policy.length.__dict__   # frozen dataclasses; defaults come from the spec

    which is a no-op expression statement. It reads an attribute and discards it. Every
    value under `cleaning:` in the config was silently ignored and the LengthPolicy
    defaults were used instead: min_chars 200, min_tokens 50, max_tokens 20000, rather
    than the configured 800 / 150 / 400.

    The consequence was invisible in the run output. Rejection counts looked healthy, the
    quota was met, and nothing errored. Only the token-count distribution of the WRITTEN
    corpus revealed it: 65 percent of documents fell outside the configured range and one
    document was 19,639 tokens, which is 51 training windows all carrying one label.

    LengthPolicy and QualityPolicy are frozen, so they must be constructed, not mutated.
