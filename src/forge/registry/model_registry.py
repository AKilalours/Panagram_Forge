"""Model registry and promotion.

A model version is not weights. It is weights plus config plus dataset_version plus code
commit plus metrics plus environment. Anything less cannot be reproduced or audited, and a
detector whose output affects people needs to be auditable.

Promotion is gated, in this order, and every step can refuse:

    registered -> gate passed -> canary -> production

The gate is `forge.evaluation.release_gate.evaluate`. Promotion cannot skip it, and
`promote` refuses a candidate whose gate result is absent rather than treating "not
evaluated" as "no failures found". Those are opposite things and conflating them is how a
model that was never tested reaches production.
