"""Hard negative mining. The heart of FORGE.

    human reserve pool -> current detector -> high-confidence false positives
      -> embed -> cluster (Failure Atlas) -> sample across clusters
      -> targeted mirrors -> retrain

The claim under test in this whole project is that choosing WHICH synthetic data to
generate, based on where the current model actually fails, buys more robustness per
example than generating more data at random. Everything here exists to make that
comparison fair.

Three properties this module is built to guarantee.

**The reserve pool is never trained on wholesale.** Only documents mining selects, and
the mirrors generated from them, enter training. Training on the whole pool would be
"more data", which is the baseline this is supposed to beat.

**Confidence gating, not just error counting.** A document the model called AI at 0.51
is a coin flip near the threshold and tells you nothing about a failure mode. One it
called AI at 0.97 is the model being confidently wrong, which is both the expensive
error in production and the informative one for training.

**Mined ids are remembered across rounds.** The flywheel turns repeatedly. Without a
ledger, round two re-mines the same easy-to-find failures, the training set fills with
duplicates of one mode, and the measured improvement is an artifact of oversampling.

Nothing in this file has met a real failure yet. It is tested against synthetic score
distributions, and it stays untested against real ones until Phase 3 trains a model.
