"""Phase 3. Long-document inference by overlapping windows.

Truncating at 512 tokens means a document that is human for 400 tokens and AI for the
next 4,000 is scored entirely on its human opening. Windows of 512 with stride 384
give a 128-token overlap so no boundary falls in a blind spot.

Whether prediction smoothing across windows actually improves boundary F1 is an
experiment, not an assumption. See data_spec_v1 section 10, item 3.
