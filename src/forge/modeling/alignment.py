"""Character spans to per-token labels.

This is the highest-risk pure function in Phase 3. The spec deliberately stores token
supervision as CHARACTER spans, because token indices are tokenizer-dependent and the
tokenizer will change. That decision moves the risk here, into the alignment step.

Three ways this goes wrong quietly:

  Off-by-one at a boundary. A token straddling a human/AI seam gets whichever label the
  comparison happens to favour. With 512-token windows and one seam per document, a
  systematic off-by-one shifts every boundary in the corpus by one token, and boundary
  F1 reports a real-looking number that is wrong by a constant.

  Special tokens. [CLS] and [SEP] have offset (0, 0). Assigning them a real label trains
  the model to predict authorship for tokens that carry no text, and they appear in every
  window, so the effect is large.

  Whitespace-only tokens between spans. They must inherit a label rather than being
  dropped, otherwise the label sequence has holes the loss silently ignores.

The rule used here: a token is labelled by the span covering the MAJORITY of its
characters. Ties go to the earlier span. That is deterministic and symmetric, and it is
stated here so the choice is visible rather than emergent.
