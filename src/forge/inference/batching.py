"""Dynamic batching.

The tradeoff is explicit: waiting adds latency to every request and multiplies
throughput. The wait window is tuned against the P95 latency budget in the release gate,
not chosen by feel.

The queue policy below is FIFO on purpose. Sorting by length to reduce padding waste is
the obvious optimisation and it starves long documents indefinitely under load, which
shows up as a P99 latency cliff on exactly the requests users care most about. FORGE
windows every document to a fixed 512 tokens anyway, so padding waste is bounded and the
optimisation buys little.

`plan_batches` is pure and tested. The server loop that consumes it is not, because it
needs a live model.
