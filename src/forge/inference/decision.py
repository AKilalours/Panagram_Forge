"""Turning a score into a decision, including the decision not to decide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstention
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A detector operating at a 0.1 percent FPR budget is tuned so that being wrong about a
human is very expensive. Forcing every document into a binary call throws that away in
the region where the model is least sure. A document scoring 0.52 against a threshold of
0.51 is reported as "AI" with the same interface as one scoring 0.999, and a reader has
no way to tell them apart.

So the decision has three outcomes, not two:

    score < abstain_low        -> human
    abstain_low <= score < hi  -> UNCERTAIN, no claim made
    score >= abstain_high      -> ai

The uncertain band is derived from the calibrated score, which is why calibration is a
release-gate criterion rather than a nicety. It is a product decision as much as a
technical one: an AI-detection result is frequently used in ways that affect a person,
and "I do not know" is a legitimate and much safer answer than a coin flip dressed as a
verdict.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provenance on every response
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every decision carries the model version, the operating threshold and the FPR budget the
threshold was calibrated against. A score without those is uninterpretable: 0.96 means
nothing unless you know what the model was tuned to protect.
