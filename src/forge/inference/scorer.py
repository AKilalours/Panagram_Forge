"""Load a trained arm and score one document, on CPU.

This exists so the UI and the API score text the same way the evaluation did. The window
size, stride, aggregation and threshold all come from the arm's own config and its committed
`summary.json`, not from constants retyped here. If evaluation and serving disagree about
any of those, the number a user sees is not the number the results tables describe.

**Mean over windows is the score, max is reported alongside.** That matches
`scripts/eval_ood.py`. Max pooling raises the score of any long document that contains one
unusual passage, which inflates FPR on exactly the human writing this project exists to
protect.

**The threshold is the DEPLOYED one**, fit on the arm's validation split at the 0.1% FPR
budget and read from `summary.json`. It is the only threshold available outside an
experiment. The optimistic re-fit thresholds used in the OOD comparison are not usable here
and are not offered.

**Abstention is off unless a validation score file exists.** `decision.band_from_validation`
derives the uncertain band from validation scores, and those are not committed (they come
from the corpus, which this project does not redistribute). Picking a band by eye would
produce either an abstention rate nobody accepts or a band that never fires, so the policy
reports `abstains=False` with a stated reason rather than inventing one.

**Out-of-distribution behaviour, stated because the UI cannot detect it.** These checkpoints
were trained on four generator families at 1.7B to 3.8B parameters. Against unseen
generators they miss 63% to 96% of AI text at this threshold and their ECE rises from 0.004
to between 0.18 and 0.44. A confident score here is not evidence of a confident model. See
docs/evaluation.md.
