"""One analysis, two shells.

`api/forge_app.py` served this over HTTP and `streamlit_app.py` needs the identical result
in-process. Writing the scoring loop twice would put the two pages one edit apart from
disagreeing about what a verdict is, which is the failure this project has shipped in
several forms already. Both call `analyse` and render the same payload.

The decision policy is not reimplemented here either. Thresholds come from each arm's
committed summary.json and the verdict comes from forge.inference.decision.decide, so there
is exactly one place where a score becomes a claim.

    Both rather than one, because the comparison IS the project. A single verdict hides the
    thing the experiment measured, and the arms genuinely disagree near the threshold: on
    RAID, 122 documents arm A misses arm B catches.

    An arm that cannot load reports WHY, in `unavailable`, and never falls back to a score.
    That includes running out of memory, which is a real possibility on a small host: one
    arm is roughly 740 MB in float32. A page that then shows the arm it does have, and says
    only one is loaded, is honest; one that invents the second is not.
