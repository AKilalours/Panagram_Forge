This is the join between the data lake and the model. It reads human documents, their
mirrors, and any mixed documents produced by token_labels.py, and emits fixed-width
windows with both a document label and per-token labels.

The one rule enforced here that nothing else can enforce: **a window's document label is
computed from its own content**, via modeling/dataset.py. A mostly-human document with one
AI paragraph must not stamp "ai" on its mostly-human windows.

    data, produced identical numbers, and supported the conclusion "matched mirrors make
    no difference".

    Nothing would have errored. Two successful runs, two plausible rows in the results
    table, one false finding. So the arm is now declared in the config and verified
    against the `prompt_version` recorded on every generated document.

    `ai_cap` holds the AI budget equal across arms. Generation produces a different
    NUMBER of accepted documents per arm, because each arm's validator rejects at its own
    rate: the mirror arm accepts a length ratio in [0.6, 1.6], the random arm [0.5, 2.0],

    on thousands more documents than the other and the comparison stops being about

    WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not a nicety.

    The mirror arm's validator rejects a generation whose length ratio to its source falls
    outside [0.6, 1.6]. Generation used one max_new_tokens for every document, so a short
    source could never be matched: the model wrote to the cap and overshot. Length
    overshoot was 85% of all rejections, and the documents that survived skew long.

    The control arm draws its target lengths from the whole human corpus, so it does not
    skew. Capping both arms to the same COUNT therefore leaves them differing in length
    distribution as well as in matching, and a detector can learn length. A win for either
    arm would then have an obvious alternative explanation.

    Matching the distribution at cap time removes that confound without regenerating
    anything. Selection stays deterministic: within each (split, length bin) cell, documents
    are ranked by a salted hash of their id.

    Where a cell in `rows` cannot supply its full share, the shortfall is redistributed
    across the remaining cells rather than silently shrinking the result, so the returned
    count is exact and the arms stay equal in size as well as in shape.
