"""FORGE on Streamlit Community Cloud. The same detectors, a different shell.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The interface this project was built around is a FastAPI app in
`api/forge_app.py`, and it is still the reference. It cannot be deployed for free any more:
Hugging Face now requires a PRO subscription for Docker Spaces, and every other free host
either caps memory below one model or requires a payment card. Streamlit Community Cloud is
the one that does not, so this file is the interface layer rewritten for it.

Nothing about the detection changes. The verdict, the thresholds, the polarity resolution
and the occlusion attribution all come from `forge.*` exactly as they do in the FastAPI app.
If this page and that one ever disagree, this page is wrong.

MEMORY IS THE DESIGN CONSTRAINT. The free tier is about 2.7 GB of RAM. One text arm is a
float32 DeBERTa-v3-base at roughly 740 MB resident, and the FastAPI page loads both at once
to compare them. Two arms plus torch plus the image detector does not fit, and the failure
mode is the container being killed mid-request, which a reader cannot interpret. So this
page holds ONE arm at a time and says so, and switching arms evicts the other rather than
quietly accumulating. The two-arm comparison is the experiment's result and it is reported
in docs/evaluation.md, where it belongs; a live page is not the place that finding lives.
