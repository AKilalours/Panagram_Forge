"""FORGE detection API.

Live now: schema, validation, decision policy, abstention, provenance, metrics. The model
is NOT loaded, because Phase 3 training has not run, and /v1/detect returns 503 with the
reason rather than a fabricated score. A stub that returns a plausible number is worse
than an error, because something downstream will build on it.

Two rules the response format enforces:

  Every response carries model_version, threshold and fpr_budget. A score of 0.96 is
  uninterpretable without knowing what the model was tuned to protect.

  "uncertain" is a first-class verdict. See forge.inference.decision for why a detector
  operating at a 0.1 percent FPR budget should decline to guess in the band where it is
  least sure.
